Seismic study of Alaska
=======================

Alaska is extremely active when it comes to earthquakes. The subducting Pacific plate causes many earthquakes in the Gulf of Alaska. Making Southern Alaska a prime spot for tomographic imaging. Northern Alaska is less active, and therefore less studied. Temporary PASSCAL deployments provide data to regions of Alaska that are of interest, including Northern Alaska. The goal of this study is to gain insight about the geological structures beneath Northern Alaska.

Using software provided by Steven Roecker, I am analyzing full seed data from iris.edu to update a catalog of seismic events for Alaska and develop a tomographic model using the same data. The data used are from PASSCAL deployments. This study uses local events for updating the catalog and the tomographic model.
